🏭 Warehouse FSM (Finite State Machine)

This project implements a Warehouse Management System using a Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture.
It supports both console and Swing GUI interfaces for interacting with clients, clerks, and managers.

📁 Project Structure

All source files are organized under WarehouseFSM/src following standard Java package conventions:

Package	Description
warehouse.*	Core domain classes and FSM console states (clients, products, transactions, etc.)
warehouse.ui.*	Swing-based GUI implementation — frame, controller, and panel classes for each user role

⚙️ Build Instructions

From the repository root (WarehouseFSM directory), compile all source files into an output folder named out.

cd WarehouseFSMGUI
# Compile all Java sources recursively
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.java | ForEach-Object { javac -encoding UTF-8 -d out $_.FullName }


💡 Tip: You can safely delete any old out folder before compiling to avoid stale class files.

▶️ Running the Application
1. Console Version

Run the original text-based FSM interface:

java -cp out warehouse.WarehouseFSMApp

2. Swing GUI Version

Launch the graphical interface:

java -cp out WarehouseGUIApp


🪶 Note: If the GUI is launched in a headless environment (no display), it will automatically fall back to the console FSM.
