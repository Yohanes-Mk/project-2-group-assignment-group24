# 🏭 Warehouse FSM (Finite State Machine)

This project implements a **Warehouse Management System** using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** architecture.  
It supports both **console-based** and **Swing GUI-based** interfaces for interacting with **Clients**, **Clerks**, and **Managers**.  
The GUI version provides a friendly interface for managing clients, products, transactions, and shipments.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

All source files are organized under `WarehouseFSM/src`, following standard Java package conventions.

| Package | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `warehouse.*` | Core domain classes and FSM console states — clients, products, transactions, etc. |
| `warehouse.ui.*` | Swing-based GUI implementation — main frame, controller, and panel classes for each FSM state. |
| `warehouse.ui.panels.*` | Individual GUI panels (Opening, Clerk, Manager, Client, Wishlist) with event handlers. |

## ⚙️ Build Instructions

From the repository root (`WarehouseFSM` directory), compile all source files into the output folder `out`.

```powershell
cd WarehouseFSM

# 🧹 Clean previous build (optional but recommended)
if (Test-Path out) { Remove-Item out -Recurse -Force }
New-Item -ItemType Directory out | Out-Null

# 🏗️ Compile all Java sources recursively
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.java | ForEach-Object {
    javac -encoding UTF-8 -d out $_.FullName
}
💡 Tip: Always delete any old out folder before compiling to avoid stale class files.

🚀 Running the Application
You can launch either the console version or the Swing GUI version.

🖥️ 1. Console Version
Run the original text-based FSM interface:


java -cp out warehouse.WarehouseFSMApp
🪟 2. Swing GUI Version
Launch the graphical Swing-based FSM interface:


java -cp out warehouse.ui.WarehouseGUIApp
🧠 Note:
If the GUI is launched in a headless environment (no display), it will automatically fall back to the console version.
