# Warehouse FSM

This project implements a warehouse management finite state machine (FSM) with
both console and Swing-based graphical interfaces. The source now follows a
standard Java package layout under `WarehouseFSM/src`:

- `warehouse.*` contains the core domain model and console states.
- `warehouse.ui.*` contains the GUI controller, frame, and Swing panels.

## Building

From the repository root, compile all sources into the `out` directory:

```powershell
cd WarehouseFSM
if (Test-Path out) { Remove-Item out -Recurse -Force }
New-Item out -ItemType Directory | Out-Null
javac -encoding UTF-8 -d out @sources.txt
```

> The `@sources.txt` file lists every source file using paths that match the
> package structure. Compiling files individually (for example, with
> `Get-ChildItem ... | ForEach-Object { javac ... }`) will no longer fail with
> missing-symbol errors.

## Running

Run the console FSM:

```powershell
java -cp out warehouse.WarehouseFSMApp
```

Run the Swing GUI:

```powershell
java -cp out warehouse.ui.WarehouseGUIApp
```

Both entry points automatically initialize the shared `WarehouseContext`
singleton. The GUI falls back to the console version when run in a headless
environment.
